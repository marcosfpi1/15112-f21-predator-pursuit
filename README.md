# Predator Pursuit

### By Marcos Pi Marrero (mpimarre)

### Description:
      A first person shooter, where the player is moving through a tunnel eliminating enemies, and weaving through traffic. Like some amusement park rides,       the player is sitting in a car where the car moves forward for them. Uniquely though, the player will have to move the car left and right as there         will be cars coming in from the other side, and the game ends when the player collides with another car, or when an enemies shoot enough at you that       you have no lives left. The enemies will appear on the walls of the tunnels.
